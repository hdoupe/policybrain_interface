PolicyBrain Interface Documentation
====================================

This site serves primarily to provide documentation for the PolicyBrain
interface. It also provides an example implementation as well as links
to other projects that have implemented this interface.

Motivation
----------

PolicyBrain has developed a set of API end points such that if a model
provides these endpoints it can easily be stood up.
